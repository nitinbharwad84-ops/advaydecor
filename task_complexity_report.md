## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

### 1. The "Value Boosters" (Recommended First)
I recommend starting with **Tasks 1, 2, 4, and 6**.
*   **Total Time:** ~1.5 hours.
*   **Result:** The site becomes 50% faster for users and much safer for the business (stock integrity).

### 2. The "Security Hardening"
Once the site is fast, we should move to **Tasks 3 and 9**.
*   **Result:** The database is protected from heavy load, and the APIs are shielded from "Script Kiddies" or bot attacks.

### 3. The "Premium Features"
Lastly, we tackle **Tasks 7, 8, and 10** to give the site that elite, industry-leading feel.
